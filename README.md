# FileClick-Self-Replicating Virus

**Disclaimer: The code provided below is for educational purposes only. It demonstrates the concept of a self-replicating virus and is not intended for malicious use. Do not use this code to harm or infect systems without proper authorization.**

## Self-Replicating Virus Explanation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates a self-replicating virus, spreading its code to other Python script files within the same directory. The purpose of this code is to showcase how a self-replicating virus could work; however, this should never be used maliciously.

The virus operates by identifying the lines of code between the markers `# VIRUS SAYS HI TO BOOMER!` and `# VIRUS SAYS BYE TO BOOMER!`. It then reads its own code and extracts this section. The virus then searches for other Python script files (`*.py` and `*.pyw`) in the same directory and infects them by adding the extracted virus code at the beginning of each file.

## How the Virus Works

1. The virus code starts with the marker `# VIRUS SAYS HI TO BOOMER!` and ends with the marker `# VIRUS SAYS BYE TO BOOMER!`. This section contains the self-replicating code that will be added to other Python script files.

2. The script reads its own code and extracts the virus code section.

3. It identifies other Python script files (`*.py` and `*.pyw`) in the same directory to infect.

4. For each target file, the virus checks if it's already infected. If not, it combines the extracted virus code with the existing code of the target file.

5. The infected files now contain the virus code at the beginning.

6. When the infected files are executed, they print "YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED HAHAHA !!!" using the `malicious_code` function.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have Python installed.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.

4. Run the virus script using the command `python virus.py`. This will infect other Python script files in the same directory.

5. Infected files will now contain the virus code.

6. Execute an infected file to see the "YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED HAHAHA !!!" message.
